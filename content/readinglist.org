#+title: My readinglist

Being unemployed and broke is not a pleasant experience, so this is my attempt to aliviate some of that by doing things that i like. Currently that is computer programming and computer programming history, operating systems(NixOS/Linux/Unix/Plan9) and orchestration(k8s,containers and networking).

These are the books, articles and lectures I have read or watched in the near past or are planning to watch in the near future.


Also *Emacs.(like holy sh@t where has this been all my life :-P)*

* Technical and non-fiction

** Online books and tutorials

Mostly longer form tutorials, often books. The differntiator is often that they are published as html online.

* Fiction

I like to read fiction and I've done it for all my life, which is close to fifty years. But in the last couple of years I've found it hard to do, because of the state of the world. If things ever calm down I'll read more fiction.

Might be ok to have a section to track some of the things I'm watching and want to watch.
