#+title: My readinglist

Just a list of books I have read or want to read. Should be treated as a nightboard stand of unread books.

* Technical and non-fiction

I like to read and learn new technical stuff. This is whats on my agenda.
It closly resembles my obsesisons at the moment which is computer programming(first Lisp then Haskell then idk ... Rust or Golang perhaps) and Operating Systems(Unix/Linux, NixOS, Kubernetes and Plan9).
*And Emacs*.

* Fiction

I like to read fiction and I've done it for all my life, which is close to fifty years. But in the last couple of years I've found it hard to do, because of the state of the world. If things ever calm down I'll read more fiction.
